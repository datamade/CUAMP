    <h3>What you need to know</h3>
    <p>Before you can register your garden for composting, the <strong>garden must appear in the CUAMP database</strong>. Complete <a href="/add.html">this form</a> to register a new garden. If you already registered your garden, then <a href="/">search for your garden by name</a>, and retrieve its unique ID: you need this ID to complete the composting form.</p>

    <h3>New municipal code in Chicago</h3>
    <p>If you wish to engage in composting at a community garden at a volume above 5 cubic yards and/or will be incorporating food scraps and/or landscape waste from offsite, then you are legally obligated to register your garden.  <a href="http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Illinois/chicago_il/title7healthandsafety/chapter7-28healthnuisances?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:chicago_il$anc=JD_7-28-715" target="_blank">Section 7-28-715(3)(iii)</a> lays out the requirements of Tier I or Tier II Garden Composting Operations. In addition, <a href="http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Illinois/chicago_il/title7healthandsafety/chapter7-28healthnuisances?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:chicago_il$anc=JD_7-28-715" target="_blank">Section 7-28-715(3)(iii)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/content/dam/city/depts/dol/rulesandregs/GardenCompostingOperations01.10.18.pdf">the Rules for Garden Composting Operations</a> require garden composting operators to register on-line by April 1st of every year. The operator must keep the information current by updating the registration within 14 days of any change.</p>
    <p>Answering the questions on the compost form will fulfill your registration obligation. If you have any questions regarding your registration, please send an email to <a href="mailto:gardencomposting@cityofchicago.org">gardencomposting@cityofchicago.org</a>.</p>
