    <h2><strong>Compost registration</strong></h2>
    <h3>What you need to know</h3>
    <p>Before you can register your garden for composting, the <strong>garden must appear in the CUAMP database</strong>. Complete <a href="/add.html">this form</a> to register a new garden. If you already registered your garden, then <a href="/">search for your garden by name</a>, and retrieve its unique ID: you need this ID to complete the composting form.</p>
    <p>If you plan to accept off-site waste, then you are legally obligated to register your garden for composting. However, you do not need to register your garden to compost.</p>
    <h3>New municipal code in Chicago</h3>

In addition, the operator must keep the information current by updating the registration within 14 days of any change.</p>
    <p>Answering the questions on the compost form will fulfill your registration obligation. If you have any questions regarding your registration, please send an email to <a href="mailto:gardencomposting@cityofchicago.org">gardencomposting@cityofchicago.org</a>.</p>
